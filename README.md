# _MonoGameQuest_

This is a work-in-progress [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/) port of [BrowserQuest](http://browserquest.mozilla.org/). The idea is to make a game that is visually and behaviorally identical to BrowserQuest, but made as if it was an original MonoGame game (i.e., not a straight port), as a way to learn and explore 2D game development with MonoGame.
